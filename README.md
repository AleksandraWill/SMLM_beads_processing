# SMLM_beads_processing
FluorescenceBeadAnalysis_test_1.m is a MATLAB script designed to analyze bead samples captured as z-stack images. The input is a multi-frame TIFF file representing a whole field-of-view z-stack.

# The script performs the following automated steps:
Loads a user-selected whole field of view z-stack TIFF image.\
Identifies and analyzes bright objects corresponding to actual fluorescent beads in the central frame of the stack using adaptive thresholding and connected component analysis.\
Filters detected beads by intensity and proximity to image borders, ensuring only well-separated, valid beads are considered.\
Assigns a unique index to each retained fluorescent bead.\
Saves centroid coordinates, mean intensity, and the bead’s distance from the image center in a MATLAB .mat table.\
Crops each bead’s region from the original z-stack, saving them as individual z-stack TIFF files for further analysis or inspection.\
Optionally, displays visualizations and cropped bead images for user inspection.

Note: All steps are automated except for the initial file selection, which is interactive.

# Example Input File
avg_pos1.tif
(A z-stack TIFF image of the entire microscopy field of view containing multiple actual fluorescent beads.)

# Output Generated by the Script
Result Figures\
Figure_1.tif: Visualization of detected and numbered fluorescent beads overlaid on the whole field of view image.\
Figure_2.tif: Displays a multi-panel overview summarizing the detected fluorescent beads, with each panel showing a cropped region centered on an individual bead, labeled with its assigned number, (x, y) coordinates, and radial distance (R) from the image center. This figure provides visual confirmation of bead detection accuracy for all analyzed beads in the field of view.

Cropped Bead Z-Stacks\
Individual TIFF files for each detected bead region, e.g., avg_pos1_Bead1.tif, avg_pos1_Bead2.tif, etc., each preserving the z-stack structure but containing only the region around the bead.

Centroid Data Table\
avg_pos1_centroids.mat: MATLAB .mat file containing a table for all detected and filtered fluorescent beads with columns:
  - BeadNumber: Unique index assigned to each bead
  - X: Centroid x-coordinate
  - Y: Centroid y-coordinate
  - MeanIntensity: Mean intensity of the bead region
  - R: Distance from the image center
